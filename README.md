# getting-cleaning-data-project
This is the work associated with the course project in the Coursera class "Getting and Cleaning Data"

Run the run_analysis.R file in order to get an output text file like "average_of_all_measures_with_mean_or_std.txt". You will need to run it in the root directory of the repo.

The script combines the test and training set Samsung data (found in the folder UCI_HAR_Dataset) into one data set, extracts only the measures that were calculated using the mean or standard deviation, and then it outputs a file with the average values for each unique combination of activities (e.g. Laying, Sitting, Standing) and Subjects (e.g. 1, 2, 3), which number represents a unique person in the study.

With any questions about the analysis, please contact spencerrpeterson@gmail.com.
